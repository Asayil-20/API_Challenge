# API Challenge 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the integration of **APIs** with **Python** to fetch, process, and analyze data programmatically.  
The main goal is to showcase how developers and data scientists can leverage APIs to automate workflows, gather insights, and build intelligent applications.  

The notebook includes:  
- Fetching data from APIs.  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Exploratory analysis.  
- Presenting structured results.
